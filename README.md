# Custom Interpreter Written in GoLang
- This project was done with the purpose of achieving a better understanding of what's happening under the hood in modern programming languages when they're being interpreted
- To do this, I built my own custom interpreter in GoLang following the textbook **Writing An Interpreter by Thorsten Ball**
- As a side effect, I also gained some basic familiarity with Go which is a nice plus
