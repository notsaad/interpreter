# Custom Interpreter Written in GoLang
- This project was done with the purpose of achieving a better understanding of what's happening under the hood in modern programming languages when they're being interpreted
- To do this, I built my own custom interpreter in GoLang following the textbook **Writing An Interpreter by Thorsten Ball**
- As a side effect, I also gained some basic familiarity with Go which is a nice plus

# What does it support:
- Supports variables, functions, conditional statements, return statements, error handling, and more (refer to textbook or this repo for more information)


# Example:

Example of the interpreter running in a REPL from the terminal.

# Notes:
- No garbage collection (Go's GC is used)
- No formal support for printing, strings, and many other things (for now...)
